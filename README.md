i will be using Readme literally....this ia a simple order and payment app for small business food vendors, the whole point of the backend is to design a lightweight and effective app for the above purspose, im trying to build the api as a sub-tenant api, but im going to start simple, build it in pieces, make it less of a container and more of a fabric material that can be sewn into whatever ridiculously beautiful dress the front end wants, as long as they understand the material they are working with, the backend of this app will not be about what the client wants(that will be up to their frontend) but rather about what their business or service needs, it wiil be in pieces....that being said, it is firstly a fullstack(python(flask)/(reactjs and react native)) project for my gal, the long talk above is just to express my goal for the backend api
